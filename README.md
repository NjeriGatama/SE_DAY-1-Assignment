Day one assignment 
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is basicaly the priciples, methods and tools used to develop and maintain high quality software systems. It is important to the technology industry beacuse it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power the various aspects of modern life 
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
These include operating systems, web applications, mobile apps and embeded systems 
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The first phase is gathering and documenting the user needs and system requiremnets. The second stage, also known as design,involves creating high level and detailed designs of the software arcitecture and user interface. The third stage, also known as the implementation, involves writing code and bulding the software according to design specifications. The fourth statge, also known as testing, involves conducting various tests to ensure that the software meets quality, standards and quality expectations. The fifth stage, also known as deployment involves releasing the software to users or cutsomers. The sixth stage, also known as meintenance involves providing on going support, updates and enhancements to software after deployment. 
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The agile methodlogy is iterative and incremental and is focused on flexibilty, collaboration and respinding to change. The waterfall methodoly on the other hand is a sequential approach with disntinct phases , that flows down like a waterfall
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is repsonsible for writing code and implementing software solutions. A quality assuarnace engineer is responsible for ensuring software quality by designing and executing test plans. A project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software products
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each
IDE's provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. A good exaple is VS code. VCS's provide an environment to track changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. A good example is Github 
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome 
Some of the challenges faced by software engineers inlcude change of requirements during the development cycle, not being able to meet the deadlines and technical debt.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is testing individual components or modules of the software. Integration testing is testing inetractions between diffrent components or subsytems  and acceptance testing is tesing the software againist user requirement to ensure it meets its user needs. 


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible answers from AI models. It makes sure that the questions we ask AI models are clear and specific. 
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
